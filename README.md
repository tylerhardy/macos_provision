# My Mac OS Provision

My Ansible Playbook for my Mac

```

    Run [ run.sh ] in `non sudo` mode to run the playbooks.
    Ansible will automatically ask for sudo password when required.

```

### Coming Soon

    - Add `tags` to Tasks for Modular Updates (Not using `roles` in this one!)
    - Install Apps via the Mac App Store. Its possible!
    - iTerm2 Defaults
    - And few more changes.

### Bugs
    - Ansible is asking for password multiple times; need to look into it.
