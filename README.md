# My Mac OS Provision

My Ansible Playbook for my Mac

```
    Run [ run.sh ] on `non sudo` mode to run the playbooks.
    Ansible will automatically ask for sudo password when required.

```

### Comming Soon

    - Add Tags for updates and for smaller groups
    - I dont think I'll be using roles for this one!
    - Install Apps via the Mac App Store. (pssshh.. It actually is possible; I'm going to update this soon!)
